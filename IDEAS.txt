THEME: Near Sighted / Blind

Horror
    - Vision taken away
    - line-of-sight?
    - vision not reliable far away
        - As things get closer they reveal their true form
        - Can't tell if something is friend of foe from a distance
        - Flashlight reveals true form

Goal:
    - Ride your bike to check on grandma
        - When you arrive she asks if you've shined the flashlight on yourself
    - Wake up
    - Find someone

Monsters:
    To keep the player on their toes, they should not be able to predict
    what is and what is not dangerous.

    Monster eyes will (sometimes) be visible in the darkness, though they
    will intentionally be misleading. A bush could have eyes, or a monster might
    not. 

    Another idea is something looks dangerous, charges the player, then turns to
    mist (particles) as they go through them
